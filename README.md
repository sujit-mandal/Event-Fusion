### 4. Booking

Our platform allows clients to book their chosen event packages directly through the website.

### 5. Private Routes

We prioritize user privacy and security by implementing private routes. Only authenticated users can access specific features, such as booking, event details, and account management. This ensures that sensitive information and actions are protected.

Our platform offers a convenient "Upcoming Event" tracking feature. Users can easily monitor and stay informed about their upcoming events, including event dates, times, and venue details. This feature ensures clients are well-prepared for their special occasions.

Our social event management project, powered by React.js, simplifies event planning with six categories. Users register, select event packages, and securely book through private routes. Detailed package information and an upcoming event tracker enhance the user experience. It's an efficient, user-friendly solution for seamless event management.
